# PlayNLearn
Purpose: I found many many matching game apps for toddler but haven't see any unique app let parent be creative.
Therefor, this app allow parent (myself) be creative at anytime and any level I want. for example, most match game
only came with pre-load images and name such Car, Color, Animals etc. this app allow parent to upload their own
contents such images/photo and giving name/title of their choice. The photo can be family, relative, toys, things
or any nature photo or even Math and Science. When toddler play, he/she can drag-n-drop image matching name/title
that giving by parent.

Target Audience: for toddler age 2 and up.
Contents Creator: from age 13 and older.

User types: for toddler, parent want he/she play matching photo and name by drag-n-drop. For adult or young teenage
who want to be creative for their toddler or little sister/brother what to learn.
